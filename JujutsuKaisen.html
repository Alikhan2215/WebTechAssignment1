  <h1>Jujutsu Kaisen</h1>
  <img src="img/Jujutsu%20Kaisen%20img.jpg" alt="Jujutsu Kaisen" width="200px">
  <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is the story of Yuji Itadori, an easygoing high school student who joins the occult
    club at school. When they accidentally summon grotesque creatures by messing with a cursed object,
    Itadori fights to save his friends’ lives. A sorcerer, drawn to the school by the dangerous object,
    reveals that it grants powerful cursed energy when swallowed. Desperate to save everyone, Itadori
    swallows the talisman—a decomposed finger. As a result, he’s possessed by Sukuna, the king of curses,
    and his life changes forever.</p>

  <p>Curses are monstrosities formed by an overwhelming amount of negative emotions, like shame or regret.
    The curses are drawn to places where those feelings are strongest. Unsuspecting humans are frequently
    attacked and killed by these horrors, and it’s up to brave and powerful sorcerers to destroy them before
    they cause more harm.</p>
  <p>As the new vessel for the malevolent spirit, Itadori shares his body with one of the most powerful
    curses of all. He’s sentenced to death by the curse-fighting sorcerers, who deem him too dangerous
    to leave alive, but an unconventional teacher at the sorcery school has an idea to postpone the
    execution.</p>

  <p>Sukuna’s 20 fingers are scattered around the world. If Itadori can track down and ingest every finger,
    he’ll absorb even more of the curse into his body. If Itadori is then killed, the curse will be
    completely destroyed along with him. The young student accepts the mission to put an end to Sukuna
    once and for all. He enrolls in Jujutsu Tech High School to learn sorcery techniques to aid in the
    search for the remaining fingers.</p>
